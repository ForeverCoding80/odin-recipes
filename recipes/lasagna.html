    <p> <h2>Ingredients for Lasagna</h2> </p>
    <p> <ul>Ground beef: We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna but a lean ground beef is perfectly acceptable. You can also sub half of the beef with Italian sausage for variety.
        Onion: we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well
        Garlic cloves: you can add more if you love garlic
        Red wine: This amps up the flavor of your sauce (do not use cooking wine). You can sub wine with beef broth or stock.
        Marinara sauce: Use homemade marinara or store-bought.
        Dried thyme: Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted
        Sugar: balances the acidity of the tomatoes
        Parsley: flat-leaf or curly parsley works well
        Lasagna noodles: Cook these al dente; they will continue to soften as the lasagna bakes. You can also use no-boil noodles.
        Cottage cheese: adds great texture and moisture.
        Ricotta cheese: we use low-fat or part-skim ricotta
        Mozzarella cheese: An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice
        Egg: helps hold the cheese layer together </ul></p>

    <p><h2> Directions</h2></p> 

        <p><ol> 
            <li> gather all ingredients.</li> 
            <li> preheat oven </li>
           <li>  Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
           <li> Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.</li>
            <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
