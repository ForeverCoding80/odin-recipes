    <p> <h2>Ingredients for Lasagna</h2> </p>
    <p> <ul>Ground beef: We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna but a lean ground beef is perfectly acceptable. You can also sub half of the beef with Italian sausage for variety.
        Onion: we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well
        Garlic cloves: you can add more if you love garlic
        Red wine: This amps up the flavor of your sauce (do not use cooking wine). You can sub wine with beef broth or stock.
        Marinara sauce: Use homemade marinara or store-bought.
        Dried thyme: Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted
        Sugar: balances the acidity of the tomatoes
        Parsley: flat-leaf or curly parsley works well
        Lasagna noodles: Cook these al dente; they will continue to soften as the lasagna bakes. You can also use no-boil noodles.
        Cottage cheese: adds great texture and moisture.
        Ricotta cheese: we use low-fat or part-skim ricotta
        Mozzarella cheese: An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice
        Egg: helps hold the cheese layer together </ul></p>
